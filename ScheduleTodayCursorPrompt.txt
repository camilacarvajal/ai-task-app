# Daily Planning -- scheduletoday

You are creating a daily plan for the user. The goal is to offload the "what should I do?" decision entirely so they just execute.

## Step 1: Check energy level

Ask the user: "How's your energy today? (low / medium / high)"

If they already stated their energy in the message, skip the question.

## Step 2: Read current context

Read these files (or the equivalent in their workspace) to understand what's active:
- Their task list (e.g. `Tasks/personal.md`) — active tasks and deadlines
- Job pipeline if they use one (e.g. `job-search/pipeline.md`) — active opportunities
- Check for any overdue or time-sensitive items
- Check Google Calendar for upcoming events and any changes
- Look for fun or creative tasks to recommend

## Step 3: Build the plan

### Low energy (1 task + recovery)
- Pick 1 small, completable task (admin, follow-up, under 30 min)
- Suggest a recovery activity (from their self-knowledge or recovery notes if they have a Hands-On Recovery section, matching energy tier)
- Include the Minimum Viable Day floor: eat something, step outside for 2 min, do the 1 task
- Remind them: "If you do this one thing, the day counts."

### Medium energy (3–4 things)
- Pick 3–4 tasks mixing: at least 1 job/career + 1 life admin + 1 fun/learning/creative
- Prioritize anything with an upcoming deadline
- Suggest Pomodoro rhythm: 25 min work / 5 min wander, 3 cycles then a real break

### High energy (up to 5 things)
- Pick 3–5 tasks, front-loading the hardest or most important
- This is the day for interviews, deep work, networking, or "critical" items
- Still suggest breaks — high energy is not infinite energy
- Remind them to stop before crashing, not after

## Step 4: Output format and save to today.md

**Always save the plan to their today file** (e.g. `Tasks/today.md`, or the path they use with the Today app). Overwrite the file with:
- Header: `# [Day], [Month] [Date], [Year]`
- Section: `## Today's plan ([energy level] energy)` with the task list, minimum viable day (if low energy), recovery/fun, and remember. If they have a recurring monthly check-in (e.g. on the 15th), add a note when that date is relevant.
- Section: `## Calendar` — table of events for the next 3 days (from Google Calendar) or "Nothing scheduled".
- Section: `## Job Pipeline` — brief pipeline counts and next follow-ups (if they use a pipeline file), or omit.
- Section: `## Upcoming Deadlines` — next 5–7 deadlines from context.

Then show the user the plan in chat.

**Plan format:**
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3 (if applicable)

**Recovery/fun:** [two suggestions]

**Remember:** [one relevant reminder from their notes if available, or a general supportive line; rotate when possible]

## Key principles
- Fewer tasks done > many tasks attempted. Don't overload.
- Include something interesting or novel when possible.
- If the task list feels overloaded, say so directly.
- Be decisive. Pick tasks FOR them. Don't present 5 options to choose from.
- The goal is a trellis, not a cage.
- When they ask for daily priorities or a weekly review near a recurring check-in date (e.g. 15th), remind them if that applies.
